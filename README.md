# FlowerCNN
Convolutional Neural Network for Flower Images

Using google's colab I develoepd and improved a CNN to classify flower images from a keras dataset.
For this project I utilized pytorch and keras libraries, inlcuding data augmentation, splitting trainign and test data, and building and training the model
To view the results of the project I used matplotlib, creating a confusion matrix, model performance graph over time, and displaying some of the misclassified images.
After various runs the CNN was able to achieve between 72% and 76% test accuracy
